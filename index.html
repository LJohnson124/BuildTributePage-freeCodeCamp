    <h3>Here's a timeline of Adele's life</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1988</strong> - Born in Tottenham, London</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Her mother was 18 years old when she was born</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>1992</strong> - Adele's father left her and her mother when she was 4 years old</li>
        <li><strong>Childhood</strong> - She was always close to her mother, and was encouraged by her mother to explore her creative side. And from a young age, Adele loved music and singing</li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Inspirations</strong> - Adele liked the artists Lauryn Hill, Mary J. Blige, and Destiny's Child</li>
          <li>She had a musical awakening when she listened to Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald. Even though the music was "cheesy", she was inspired that people still listened to the music decades after it was made</li>
          <li> This inspired Adele to make music that would last the tests of time</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>2002</strong> - Though Adele was a bright child, she wasn't meant for the traditional classroom setting. So, at the age of 14, she went to the BRIT School of Performing Arts and Technology and left public school</li>
        <li><strong>2008</strong> - Adele came out with her first album, "19", which gained instant success. In the same year, she won the esteemed Brit Critic's Choice Award. When her album came to America, it was a even bigger hit than it was in the U. K</li>
        <ul>
          <li>This album also set off the trend of her naming her albums after her age. Up to this point, all her albums are titled after her age</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>2011</strong> - Her second album, "21" came out. It was another hit, with some of her most popular songs such as:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>"Rolling in the Deep"</li>
          <li>"Someone Like You"</li>
          <li>"Set Fire to the Rain"</li>
          <li>"Rumour Has It"</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>2012</strong> - She co-wrote and sang the song "Skyfall", for the James Bond movie with same name</li>
        <li><strong>2015</strong> - Adele's most recent album, "25", was another hit. The 2 popular songs from this album are:</li>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <li><strong>2018</strong> - It was reported that Adele is working on her 4th album</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Adele also said that this time, she is not naming her album off her age, and that "25"was the last time she was naming her albums after her age</li>
        </ul>
